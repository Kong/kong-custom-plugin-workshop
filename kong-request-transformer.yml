# This is an example file to get you started with using
# declarative configuration in Kong.

# Metadata fields start with an underscore (_)
# Fields that do not start with an underscore represent Kong entities and attributes

# _format_version is mandatory,
# it specifies the minimum version of Kong that supports the format

_format_version: "2.1"

# _transform is optional, defaulting to true.
# It specifies whether schema transformations should be applied when importing this file
# as a rule of thumb, leave this setting to true if you are importing credentials
# with plain passwords, which need to be encrypted/hashed before storing on the database.
# On the other hand, if you are reimporting a database with passwords already encrypted/hashed,
# set it to false.

_transform: true

# A kong config file has an associated workspace. By default,
# "default" workspace is used but can be changed via the metadata
# field _workspace

# _workspace: workspace-foo

# Each Kong entity (core entity or custom entity introduced by a plugin)
# can be listed in the top-level as an array of objects:

# When an entity has multiple foreign-key relationships
# (e.g. a plugin matching on both consumer and service)
# it must be specified as a top-level entity, and not through
